## Introduction to Whycon Markers
WhyCon is a computer vision based system which can be used to localize mobile robots upto mm precision. Generally we use external localization systems based on GPS, ultrasound, ir, radio, multi camera systems. But they are expensive, complex and also may take more weight. So such systems cannot be used for small robots or swarms if we need a low-cost robot. 
Whycon markers solve this problem by using very less computation, low-cost camera and good precision in pose estimation. They are concentic circles with  a white background. It uses different image processing techniques to localize the robot and estimate the pose.
